/*
 * omega_gpu_serving.h: OPT-IN up-front reservation of the GB10 serving buffers (sovereign-core design
 * note docs/design/gb10-weight-ownership.md, sc#277).
 *
 * Without this call nothing changes: the attention staging pool, the matmul activation and result
 * buffers and the matmul kernel cache grow on demand, which on the GB10 means one driver allocation
 * per new context length and per row-count growth (omega PR #332 measured 458 after warm-up over 428
 * tokens). With it, a daemon calls omega_gpu_reserve_serving once after loading weights, and every
 * later call inside the declared bounds reuses the same buffers. A call outside the bounds is refused
 * with TOO_LARGE and a clear omega_gpu_*_last_error() text ("serving reservation exceeded: need N
 * bytes, reserved M"); it never asks the driver for more memory, so it cannot fault the session.
 *
 * Not covered (documented follow-ups): the elementwise API's scratch (it stops growing after the
 * first full-size call), the attention kernel cache (8 slots, one kernel per model shape), and the
 * first build of each distinct matmul shape (one small code buffer per shape, kept for good when
 * kernel_slots covers the shapes of the model).
