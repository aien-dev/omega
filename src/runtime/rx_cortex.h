/*
 * rx_cortex.h -- Cortex, AIEN's durable typed memory. CANONICAL (M20).
 *
 * AUTHORITY (M20, 2026-09-30). This file is the one canonical Cortex
 * contract. Every authoritative Cortex write goes through cx_append or
 * cx_append_as on a CxStore defined here, and a store has at most one writer:
 * cx_claim_writer inside a process, an exclusive lock on the journal across
 * processes. Chosen because it is the C implementation in the runtime tree
 * that owns World (rx_world.c), the one the runtime already calls
 * (rx_projection.c), and the only one the no-Rust rule allows to grow.
 *
 * Non-authoritative implementations (not edited here, never a second writer):
 *
 *   aien-sovereign-core crates/cortex-rs   Linux LLM-stack memory service
 *                                          (HTTP :18080; callers aien-cli
 *                                          src/cortex.rs, spark-mail-rs
 *                                          src/cortex_sync.rs).
 *   aienos crates/aienos-cortex            Rust epistemic store (callers
 *                                          aienos-aegis, aienos-kernel
 *                                          src/continuity.rs).
 *
 * Their records are not AIEN memory until they enter this store, and they
 * enter only as CX_K_IMPORTED claims whose tag names the source (CX_SRC_*):
 * never as facts and never by writing a journal directly. Removal path, per
 * aien-architecture docs/plans/RUST_TO_C_MIGRATION.md §6 ("port or retire"):
 * both are retired, not ported. (1) No new caller may be added to either.
 * (2) Whatever is worth keeping is imported as CX_K_IMPORTED records through
 * cx_append_as. (3) The crates are deleted. Until step 3 nothing may treat
 * them as a source of truth.
 *
 * Cortex holds what the machine has seen, done, claimed and proven. It is
 * append-only: an object, once recorded, never changes, and its digest says
 * so. Nothing in Cortex is text. Every object is a fixed header plus a
 * payload of 64-bit words.
 *
 * Two axes, never merged:
 *
 *   content class  what the object IS: one of the nine memory classes of
 *                  doctrine AIEN.md §8.2 (entity, claim, observation, ...).
 *   treatment      how one cognitive operation may use it (pinned, live,
 *                  compressible, ...). Treatment is not stored here. It is
 *                  decided per operation by the state projection
 *                  (rx_projection.h).
 *
 * Protection bits are the one treatment fact Cortex does own: authority,
 * commit receipts, verification evidence, generation identity and effect
 * receipts may never be summarized, whatever an operation asks for.
 *
 * Cortex does not hand out its history. It answers typed queries: one
 * subject, one time range, one class and kind. The indexes are per subject
 * and time ordered, so a query costs the objects in its range, not the size
 * of the store. `examined` counts every object a query touched.
 *
 * Tiers: one in-memory tier, optionally backed by an append-only journal
 * file (cx_open) that is replayed and verified on reopen. Doctrine's L1/L2/L3
 * tiers (accelerator memory, host memory, NVMe) are not implemented here.
 * Cortex is memory and evidence; runtime state-space material is J-Space
 * (rx_jspace.h), not this.
