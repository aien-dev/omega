/*
 * rx_costmodel.h -- Omega's empirical cost model (OMEGA_EMPIRICAL_OPTIMIZER).
 *
 * Omega picks a realization for an operation from what it has measured, not
 * from a fixed rule. This is a calculator only:
 *
 *   features of a call  ->  predicted cost of every eligible realization,
 *                           with how sure the prediction is
 *                       ->  SELECT one, or MEASURE two when unsure
 *
 * It never runs code, never holds or reads authority, never writes a
 * generation. Whoever calls it executes the realizations and reports what
 * they cost. A learned model becomes durable only as the `model` blob of a
 * generation promoted through the R9 barrier by a subject that holds the
 * promotion right; the Makefile checks that rx_costmodel.o references none
 * of those operations.
 *
 * This is not authority learning. No feature is derived from a capability,
 * and a realization is eligible only if the caller says it was verified.
 *
 * Predictor: one Bayesian linear regression (normal-inverse-gamma, ridge
 * prior) per (cell, arm), on log2 picoseconds per call. A cell is
 * (operation class, core class, pressure bucket). Pressure cells hold a
 * two-number correction over the quiet cell of the same core class. The basis is small and
 * readable: 1, log2 M, log2 N, their product, (log2 N)^2, N <= 3,
 * N % 4 != 0, and how far the working set overflows the core's cache, in
 * doublings. Each (cell, arm) keeps only sufficient statistics, so the model
 * serializes to a fixed-size blob.
