/*
 * Simulated GB10 driver for the host test of the Blackwell GPU engine backend
 * (tests/test_omega_blackwell_engine.c). NOT_RUN: written in cut A3b2 and never
 * compiled or executed by its author.
 *
 * It replaces seven symbols of the real driver stack, so the REAL backend
 * (src/omega_blackwell_engine.c) and the REAL vector wrapper
 * (src/omega_blackwell_submit.c) run unchanged on a machine with no GPU:
 *   m16_native_open, m16_native_create_channel, m16_native_submit_methods,
 *   m16_native_wait_marker, m16_native_close, nvrm_alloc, nvrm_free.
 * The signatures come from physics/m16/m16_native.h and physics/nvrm/nvrm.h at
 * the physics pin; the fake file includes those headers, so a mismatch is a
 * compile error.
 *
 * What it models (every point is a MODEL, UNVERIFIED on the chip, confidence
 * about 70 percent that it matches the real driver):
 *   - "device" memory is host memory, GPU address equals CPU address, dirty
 *     (0x5a fill) so a missing zeroing step shows up;
 *   - the submitted pushbuffer is parsed and executed in order: DMA uploads,
 *     the two inline QMDs, the semaphore initial value, the release packets and
 *     the L2 flush memory operation (method 0x28, operation 0x10 << 27);
 *   - the vector kernel is a simple loop (c[i] = a[i] + b[i] for the threads the
 *     QMD asks for) and only runs if the program bytes in device memory are the
 *     bytes the test expects;
 *   - the second marker release is only written if an L2 flush operation
 *     appears between the two releases (modelling choice, see the doc);
 *   - m16_native_wait_marker is the real ">=" serial compare with no loop; a
 *     timeout advances the fake clock by the timeout so waited_ms is exact;
 *   - nvrm_free of a zeroed NvrmMem is a no-op that counts nothing, a real free
 *     zeroes the NvrmMem and clobbers errno (like a munmap or ioctl might).
